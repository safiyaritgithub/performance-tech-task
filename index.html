  <h1>Performance Optimization 3 techniques</h1>
  <p>Caching: Caching involves storing copies of frequently accessed resources (like HTML pages, images, CSS files, etc.) in a cache memory or disk. When a user requests a resource, the server first checks if it's in the cache. If it is, the server retrieves it from the cache instead of generating it again. This significantly reduces the server load and improves response times.Example: Implementing browser caching directives such as setting an expiration date or a maximum age for static resources (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files) can instruct the browser to cache these resources locally</p>
  <p>Minification: Minification involves removing unnecessary characters from source code without affecting its functionality. This typically includes removing comments, whitespace, and unnecessary formatting. Minification reduces file sizes, leading to faster downloads and improved loading times.Example: Before deploying code to production, developers can use minification tools to compress JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files</p>
  <p>Content Delivery Network : A CDN is a network of distributed servers strategically located across different geographic locations. Instead of serving content directly from the origin server, a CDN caches copies of website assets (such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript) on these servers.</p>
